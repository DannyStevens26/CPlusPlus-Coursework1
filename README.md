# CPlusPlus-Coursework1
My solutions to the first coursework in Introduction to C++ module.
This coursework required the use of numerical methods to estimate polynomials.

Newtonhorner containes two functions horner and newton. horner finds the horner values for a polynomial, newton uses the newton-horner method to find a root of a polynomial.

Chebyshev contains three functions chebeval, chebsum and chebcoef. chebeval calculates the Chebyshev polynomial Pn(x) using the Chebyshev recursion formula, chebsum calculates a sum using the Clenshaw algorithm and chebcoef computes the coefficients of the Chebyshev form of the interpolating polynomial.

Lagrange containes the function lagrange which evaluates the Lagrange form of the interpolating polynomial of degree n at a given point x.

q1a - q3b containe examples of the functions being used appropriately.
